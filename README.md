# Yoshki_React_compatible_SRA_logo
React compatible SRA Authorization logo for UK based Law firms (Yoshki). It was and is probably unnecessary but if you do find it useful, then great! 
There are a few issues with regards to performance when the assets are being loaded from Yoshki's CND. It is nothing major but i figured it is worth highlighting.
