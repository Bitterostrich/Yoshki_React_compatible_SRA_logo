# Yoshki_React_compatible_SRA_logo
React compatible SRA Authorization logo for UK based firms (Yoshki). It was and is probably unnecessary but if you do find it useful, then great! 
There are a few issues with regards to performace when the assets for the logo are being loaded from Yoshki's CND. It is nothing major but it is worth highlighting.
